# Classification-of-fashionMNIST-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network
Training a Convolutional Neural Network (using PyTorch) that will help to identify each cloth to match the perfect design you created. In order to train it, you decide to rely on the dataset fashion MNIST.    



Pre-requisites to run code:
1) Python
2) torchvision -- pip install torchvision
3) pytorch -- conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch
4) matplotlib -- pip install matplotlib

While running the code, check if internet is connected to download the FashionMNISt dataset commandline
if not downloaded.

To run model using different activation function
Uncomment the code with respective activation function under the class Net init function

Comment dropout layer line 64 if need to run model without dropout layer
